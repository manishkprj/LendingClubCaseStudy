## General Information

### Project Information

This data science project uses the Lending Club dataset to predict whether a loan will be defaulted or not.

### Project Background

Lending Club is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing for medical procedures. Borrowers can access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface. However, lending to risky applicants poses a significant financial loss (credit loss) to the company. Credit loss occurs when a borrower defaults on their loan. This project aims to identify the factors that lead to loan defaults.

### Project Statement

The goal is to find the driving factors that lead to loan defaults, which are a major source of financial loss for the company.

### Data Set

The dataset is a CSV file containing loan data from Lending Club.
